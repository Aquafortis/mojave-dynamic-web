A web page concept using time of day to change images.

Using simple Javascript to set time and delays.

Note: Video below is time lapsed and has added smooth transitions.

**Usage:**

Unzip the folder and run the `index.html` in your browser.

**Customise:**

Change the image set to your own if required.

Change the image `src` in the `shadows.js` file.

Instead of waiting an hour or more, you can test your images by uncommenting the `var time = new Date().getSeconds();` line in the `shadows.js` file.

Don't forget to comment out the other line.

Change the `setTimeout(start, 5000);` to `500` if using seconds.

Change the `index.html` and `style.css` to suit your needs.

That's about it.
